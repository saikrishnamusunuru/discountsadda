          <h2>Purpose</h2>
          <p>
            This document sets out our policy for responding to requests for
            deletion of data under UK data protection law. This document
            explains the rights of the data subject in relation to data deletion
            and the responsibilities of DISCOUNTS ADDA in responding with such a
            request.
          </p>

          <h2>Individual Rights</h2>

          <p>
            An individual has the right to erasure, also known as ‘the right to
            be forgotten’. The principle underpinning this right is to enable an
            individual to request the deletion or removal of personal data where
            there is no compelling reason for its continued processing
          </p>

          <h2>When does the right to erasure apply?</h2>
          <p>
            As stipulated in UK data protection law, individuals have a right to
            have personal data erased and to prevent processing in specific
            circumstances:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Where the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the
              purpose for which it was originally collected/processed
            </li>
            <li>When the individual withdraws consent</li>
            <li>
              When the individual objects to the processing and there is no
              other legal ground for the relevant processing activity
            </li>
            <li>When the personal data was unlawfully processed</li>
            <li>
              Where the personal data has to be erased in order to comply with a
              legal obligation.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What information does DISCOUNTS ADDA retain?</h2>
          <p>
            The DISCOUNTS ADDA online system “Interlace” stores data about
            individuals in order to create a Team Role Report. We store the
            name, e-mail address, gender, organisation/department (if provided)
            and subsequent Team Role scores for each individual in order to
            create a report, which is stored on our secure servers in the UK for
            a period of 90 days. This data is stored and used in accordance with
            our Privacy Policy, which can be found <a href="https://discountsadda.com/terms%20and%20conditions.html">here</a>
          </p>

          <p>
            If consent is provided, personal data (including the above, plus
            address, telephone number and notes) may be stored in our CRM system
            for the purposes of contacting you regarding DISCOUNTS ADDA news,
            products and promotions.
          </p>

          <h2>How can data be deleted?</h2>
          <p>
            If you have purchased a Team Role Report directly from Discounts
            Adda, Discounts Adda acts as data controller. In this case, we will
            delete the Team Role data (scores) upon request (via email to
            privacy@discountsadda.com), upon closure of your account, or after
            three years. If an organization purchases access to the Discounts
            Adda Online Account, Discounts Adda acts as the data processor and
            the customer acts as data controller. In this case, it is the
            responsibility of the customer, as data controller, to ensure that
            data is not held longer than necessary for the purposes for which it
            is intended. A user of the Discounts Adda Online Account, acting on
            behalf of their organization, can delete data from their Interlace
            system whenever they wish. This data is deleted from the system
            immediately and cannot be recovered by any users or DISCOUNTS ADDA
            employees after this point. Data which has been deleted or otherwise
            destroyed cannot be recovered at any time. Sufficient warning is
            given to the account administrator before data are permanently
            deleted. Data may still remain in the systems back-up files, which
            will be deleted periodically. Information may be deleted from our
            CRM upon request to privacy@discountsadda.com. We undertake to
            perform the deletion within one month (30 calendar days) and will
            send you a confirmation once the information has been deleted.
            Wherever possible, we will aim to complete the request in advance of
            the deadline
